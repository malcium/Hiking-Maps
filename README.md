Utah hiking maps for the iPhone

Map base layers provided by the Google Maps iOS SDK.

Trail data provided by the US Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management.

Duplicate data for the Forests included for now, one set are undissolved data, the other are
dissolved by name, length, and geometry. Undissolved data causes a unique trail to show up in the app
as multiple objects.

To run in the iOS simulator, download as a .zip, extract it, and open Hiking Maps.xcodeproj in Xcode and build for an iPhone.

Make sure to click on Debug->Location->Custom Location and enter a latitude of 41.7739005382797 and longitude of
-111.588962697577 in the iOS simulator to show full functionality. This is just an arbitrary Utah location that is
near the Right Hand fork of Logan Canyon. Feel free to enter any other Utah coordinate to demo the software.
